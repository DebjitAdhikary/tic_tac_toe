set up vite+react project

inside src make component folder, helper folder

react-icons used     npm install react-icons --save

react-toastify   used     npm install react-toastify --save


// if parent re-renders then child components will also re-render 



// state variables 

setter of state variable re-renders the component, not just updates it ,
    this state variables are immutable . setter of state variable is async function
    so it will wait till next re-render.


 function App(){
	    const [count,setCount]=useState(0)
	    return (
	        <>
                <button onclick={()=>{
                    setCount(count+1) // count=0
                    alert(count) //popup count value as 0
                    setCount(count+1)  //count=0
                    alert(count)  //popup count value as 0
                    setCount(count+1)  //count = 0 ,count will be zero on every line for this render
                                            because it will get updated on next re-render, 
                                            so here count will not get updated by 3 , it get 1 increament only, intention failed 

                                            react will execute all the event handler then it will re-render
                }}>click</button>
	        </>
	    )
   }



    function App(){
	    const [count,setCount]=useState(0)
	    return (
	        <>
	            <button onclick={()=>{
	            setCount((x)=>x+1) //call back fuction taking x vale as initial state of setCount i.e, 0 and updating to x
	            setCount((x)=>x+1) // here x=1+1 as x will take value from previous callback
                setCount((x)=>x+1) // here x =2+1, on next rerender count value will get increamented by 3 

                //updater function used as callback, react will queue all this updates 
                

	            }}>click</button>
	        </>
	    )
   }
